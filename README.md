## Description

The plugin adds a "Translation Stats" column to the plugin list screen in WordPress admin.

The translation stats are shown only for plugins that exist in [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/) and are [prepared for localization](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/).

If a plugin doesn't have complete translation stats, you'll see a notice with one of the reasons below:

* Plugin not found on WordPress.org
* Translation project not found on WordPress.org
* The plugin is not properly prepared for localization

The color scheme of the translation stats bars is exactly same used in [GlotPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/glotpress/) for consistency with the translation experience in [translate.wp.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/).

This plugin is properly prepared for localization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the plugin subprojects?

| Subproject             | Description                                                                                                |
| ---                    | ---                                                                                                        |
| **Development**        | Translation of the *Development* version of the plugin                                                     |
| **Development Readme** | Readme of the *Development* version of the plugin page on [wp.org/plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) |
| **Stable**             | Translation of the *Stable* version of the plugin                                                          |
| **Stable Readme**      | Readme of the *Stable* version of the plugin page on [wp.org/plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/)      |

### How can I translate a plugin?

* Register and login in [wp.org](https://login.wordpress.org/)
* Click on the plugin subproject stats bar you want to translate
* Read the Polyglots [Translator‚Äôs Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/)
* Translate according the rules of your [Locale Translation Team](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/)

### Should I translate both Stable and Development?

Since mid-April 2016, not only new strings but also edits are synced between dev and stable (both ways, only approved translations). When a plugin releases a new version all translations are copied from dev to stable. [Read more...](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/frequently-asked-questions/#should-i-translate-both-stable-and-dev)

### How long does it take for a translation to become available?

Translations for the readme are published almost immediately.
The language pack for a plugin will be generated when 90% of the Stable (latest release) sub-project strings have been translated and approved.

### Can I help translating this plugin to my own language?
